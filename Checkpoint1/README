At the most basic, you can run (with animation) a 50x50 grid at a temperature T by running:
`python isingmodel.py -g -v 50 T`
use `-g` for glauber dynamics and `-k` for kawasaki dynamics.
For more fine-tuning, run `python isingmodel.py --help`.

Included is all the code required to run over all temperatures, but the results
are included in the `results` folder.

It's small on dependancies, requiring only:
    * numpy
    * matplotlib
    * tqdm
to run the main isingmodel code, and additionally:
    * pandas
to do the data analysis.

There are two ways the code is designed to be run:
    * Just running one model for a given temperature (shown above)
    * Collecting data over a range of temperatures
    (run `python generate_data.py CONFIG` to generate a run from a config file
    CONFIG.config, and `python analyse_data.py config.config` to analyse it.)
