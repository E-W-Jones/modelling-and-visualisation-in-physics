(b)
Need dt < 0.02 for convergence
Fractions oscillate before we reach absorbing states, but these can still change. Needs ~100 equilibration sweeps too.

(c)
Times are: [67.66, 75.24, 153.42000000000002, 37.7, 54.34, 95.10000000000001, 127.68, 161.44, 118.8, 85.10000000000001]
Mean: 97.648
Std dev: 39.45117509023021
Std err: 12.475556965522623

(d)
Behaviour is more swirly? Hard to describe. Dont enter absorbing states. Dynamic equilibrium it looks like?

(e)
Subclassed Fields to RecordPoints class to make this easier.
The two periods are 32.510666666666665 and 33.09

(f)
Going to subclass again? Or not?
Basically we want to take a bunch of t values and say for each row for each distance distance between points how often are they the same type?
Im doing distance up to 50 to check we get pbcs
probability calculated a bit funnily, basically just counting how many are different over time and space, then normalising at the end
Not really sure what to say the differences are? Looks like it depends on nskip too.
From the exam feedback: "The most common issue here is that resulting plots were not sufficiently averaged (over different time steps for instance) to make the resulting trends (correlation lengthscale increasing with D) visible"
